# Rust-Project-Template

This is a template repository for Rust projects.

This template contains:
* github actions setup for linting (`cargo clippy`), consistent formatting (`rustfmt`), security advisories (`cargo deny`), and tests.
* A minimal crate setup, either for a binary or a lib.
* Helpful scripts I find myself using consistently for easy local development.
* A Dockerfile, for binary applications.

That's pretty much it.
